# EduChat

EduChat is an application for mobile devices that allows for better communication capabilities in the classroom environment. 
It can help drive participation with students being able to ask questions and discuss topics with both the teacher and their peers. It may also be used outside of the classroom to drive future discussion.

- The teacher will be able to view student discussion in one convenient place.
- Students who struggle to speak up will be able to have their thoughts and questions heard.
- Students will be able to look at each other's thoughts and questions and discuss or answer them.
